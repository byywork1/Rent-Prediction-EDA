# Summary / Table of Contents
**- Motivation:** Predict rental prices of homes given simple housing variables (e.g: bedrooms, bathrooms, sq ft, etc.).

**- EDA:** Explored data to gather a feel for the dataset and also to produce cool graphs. 

**- Data Manipulation:** Added a couple variables to assist with our model. Some worked, some didn't, stay tuned to find out. 

**- Model Training:** Trained 3 baseline models. Ended up going with XGBoost regression, used GridSearchCV to tune hyperparameters. Pretty neat stuff.

**- Model Analysis:** Plotted variable importance, reflected on how model can be improved quantitatively and emotionally.

**- Identifying Underperforming Assets:** Discussion on how assets might be identified as "underperforming". Took an income based approach to identify underperforming assets. Learned lots of cool finance concepts like: capitalization rates, DCF.
